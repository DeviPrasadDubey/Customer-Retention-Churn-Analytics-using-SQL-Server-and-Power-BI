**SQL Server | Power BI | Business Analytics**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior to identify churned customers, measure retention, and segment customers using RFM analysis. It simulates a real-world business scenario where understanding churn is critical for improving revenue and customer lifetime value.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem
The business noticed a decline in repeat customers and required insights into customer churn, retention patterns, and high-value customer segments to design data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on two core datasets:

### Customers
- `customer_id`
- `customer_name`
- `signup_date`
- `region`

### Orders
- `order_id`
- `customer_id`
- `order_date`
- `order_value`

---

## 🔍 Churn Definition
A customer is classified as **Churned** if they have not placed any order in the last **90 days**.

---

## 🧮 Key Analysis (SQL Server)
- Identified last purchase date for each customer  
- Classified customers as **Active** or **Churned**  
- Calculated **churn rate (%)**  
- Performed **RFM segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  

---

## 📈 Business KPIs
- **Churn Rate**
- **Active vs Churned Customers**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Customer Frequency**
- **Revenue Contribution by Segment**

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard provides:
- Churn overview and customer status distribution  
- RFM-based customer segmentation  
- Retention trends over time  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Customers with low purchase frequency show higher churn risk  
- Loyal customers contribute a significant portion of total revenue  
- Early churn commonly occurs within the first **60–90 days**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server**
- **Power BI**
- **Excel**

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analytics and BI dashboards can support data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
