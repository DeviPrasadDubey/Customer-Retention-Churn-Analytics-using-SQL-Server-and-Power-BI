📊 Customer Retention & Churn Analytics

(SQL Server | Power BI | Business Analytics)

Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior to identify churned customers, measure retention, and segment customers using RFM analysis. It simulates a real-world business scenario where understanding churn is critical for improving revenue and customer lifetime value.

Business Problem

The business noticed a decline in repeat customers and required insights into customer churn, retention patterns, and high-value customer segments to design data-driven retention strategies.

Dataset

The analysis is based on two core datasets:

Customers

customer_id

customer_name

signup_date

region

Orders

order_id

customer_id

order_date

order_value

Churn Definition

A customer is classified as Churned if they have not placed any order in the last 90 days.

Key Analysis (SQL Server)

Identified last purchase date for each customer

Classified customers as Active or Churned

Calculated churn rate (%)

Performed RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Business KPIs

Churn Rate

Active vs Churned Customers

Average Order Value (AOV)

Customer Frequency

Revenue Contribution by Segment

Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

Churn overview and customer status distribution

RFM-based customer segmentation

Retention trends over time

Key Insights

Customers with low purchase frequency show higher churn risk

Loyal customers contribute a significant portion of total revenue
